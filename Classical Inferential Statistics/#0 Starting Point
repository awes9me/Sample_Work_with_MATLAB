Let’s look at the example of the transportation official who wants to determine 
whether the average travel time to work has increased from the time it took in 
1995. The mean travel time to work for northern Virginia residents in 1995 was 
45 minutes. Since he wants to deter- mine whether the mean travel time has increased, 
the statistical hypotheses are given by:
H0: μ = 45 minutes
H1: μ > 45 minutes.

Let’s return to the example of the travel time to work for northern Virginia residents. 
To perform the analysis, the transportation official takes a random sample of 100 
residents in northern Virginia and measures the time it takes them to travel to work. 
He uses the sample mean to help determine whether there is sufficient evidence to reject 
the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean travel time has increased. The sample 
mean that he calculates is 47.2 minutes. This is slightly higher than the mean of 
45 minutes for the null hypothesis. However, the sample mean is a random variable and 
has some variation associated with it. If the variance of the sample mean under the 
null hypothesis is large, then the observed value of x = 47.2 minutes might not be 
inconsistent with H0 .
