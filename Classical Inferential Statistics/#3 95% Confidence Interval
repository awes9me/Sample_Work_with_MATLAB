% Continuing after #2 
% We provide an example of finding a 95% confidence interval, using 
% the transportation application of before. Recall that n = 100 , 
% x = 47.2 minutes, and the standard deviation of the travel time to 
% work is σ = 15 minutes. Since we want a 95% confidence interval, 
% α = 0.05.


% First we set some of the values we need:
mu = 45;
sig = 15;
n = 100; 
alpha = 0.05; 
xbar = 47.2;

% Get the 95% confidence interval. 
% Get the value for z_(alpha/2).
zlo = norminv(1-alpha/2,0,1);
zhi = norminv(alpha/2,0,1); 
thetalo = xbar - zlo*sig/sqrt(n); 
thetaup = xbar - zhi*sig/sqrt(n);
