PROCEDURE – BASIC MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
1. Determine the pseudo-population or model that represents the true population of interest.
2. Use a sampling procedure to sample from the pseudo-population or distribution.
3. Calculate a value for the statistic of interest and store it.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for M trials.
5. Use the M values found in step 4 to study the distribution of the statistic.

PROCEDURE – MONTE CARLO HYPOTHESIS TESTING (CRITICAL VALUE)
1. Using an available random sample of size n from the population
of interest, calculate the observed value of the test statistic, to .
2. Decide on a pseudo-population that reflects the characteristics of
the true population under the null hypothesis.
3. Obtain a random sample of size n from the pseudo-population.
4. Calculate the value of the test statistic using the random sample in step 3 and record it.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for M trials. We now have values t1, ..., tM , that serve as an estimate 
   of the distribution of the test statistic, T, when the null hypothesis is true.
6. Obtain the critical value for the given significance level α : 
   Lower Tail Test: get the α-th sample quantile, qˆα , from the
     t1, ..., tM .
   Upper Tail Test: get the (1 – α)-th sample quantile, qˆ1 – α , from the
     t1, ..., tM .
   Two-Tail Test: get the sample quantiles qα ⁄ 2 and q1 – α ⁄ 2 from the
     t1, ..., tM .
7. If to falls in the critical region, then reject the null hypothesis.

The mcdata data set contains 25 observations. 
We are interested in using these data to test the following null and alternative hypotheses:

H0: μ = 454
H1: μ < 454.
