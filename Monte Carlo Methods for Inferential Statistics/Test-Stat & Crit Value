% Now that we have the estimated distribution of the test statistic 
% contained in the variable Tm, we can use that to estimate the critical 
% value for a lower tail test.

% Get the critical value for alpha.
% This is a lower-tail test, so it is the 
% alpha quantile.
alpha = 0.05;
cv = csquantiles(Tm,alpha);

% We get an estimated critical value of –1.75. Since the observed value 
% of our test statistic is to = –2.56 , which is less than the estimated 
% critical value, we reject H0 .
