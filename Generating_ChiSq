% Write a function that will generate chi-square random variables with ν
% degrees of freedom by generating ν standard normals, squaring them and
% then adding them up. This uses the fact that X = Z1^2 + ... + Zν^2
% is chi-square with ν degrees of freedom. Generate some random variables
% and plot in a histogram. The degrees of freedom should be an input
% argument set by the user.
